    "For the collaborative part there was a big consideration to make for the Yelp dataset. While making the collaborative part for the Movielens dataset we used cosine and manhattan. While trying to implement manhattan in the Yelp dataset, we noticed that the run time to create the matrix was over an hour before we either got memory issues or we interrupted the code. Therefore, a solution has to be found. Option one would be to make our subsample smaller so that the run time decreases, and option two would be not to use manhattan for the Yelp dataset. The decision was made to not use manhattan for the Yelp dataset, because we did not want to decrease our subsample even more because this could affect the output we got for the cosine part."
